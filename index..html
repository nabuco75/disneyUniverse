          <h2>Walt Disney American film producer</h2>
          <p>
            Walt Disney, in full Walter Elias Disney, (born December 5, 1901,
            Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died December 15, 1966, Los Angeles,
            California), American motion-picture and television producer and
            showman, famous as a pioneer of animated cartoon films and as the
            creator of such cartoon characters as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.
            He also planned and built Disneyland, a huge amusement park that
            opened near Los Angeles in 1955, and before his death he had begun
            building a second such park, Walt Disney World, near Orlando,
            Florida. The Disney Company he founded has become one of the world’s
            largest entertainment conglomerates. In 1927, just before the
            transition to sound in motion pictures, Disney and Iwerks
            experimented with a new character—a cheerful, energetic, and
            mischievous mouse called Mickey. Fully recognizing the possibilities
            for sound in animated-cartoon films, Disney quickly produced a third
            Mickey Mouse cartoon equipped with voices and music, entitled
            Steamboat Willie, and cast aside the other two soundless cartoon
            films. When it appeared in 1928, Steamboat Willie was a sensation.

          <h2>Donald Duck</h2>

          <p>
            Donald Duck, an ill-tempered, squawking cartoon duck who was Walt
            Disney’s second most famous cartoon character after Mickey Mouse and
            who enjoyed worldwide popularity as the star of animated films,
            newspaper comic strips, comic books, and television. Donald Duck’s
            first film appearance was in a supporting role in The Wise Little
            Hen (1934).

          <h2>Goofy</h2>
          <p>
            Goofy is a cartoon character created by The Walt Disney Company
            Goofy debuted in animated cartoons, starting in 1932 with Mickey's
            Revue as Dippy Dawg, who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later
            the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called
            Goofy, in the short The Whoopee Party. During the 1930s, he was used
            extensively as part of a comedy trio with Mickey and Donald.
            Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were
            popular in the 1940s and early 1950s.
