          In the early 1950s Disney had initiated plans for a huge amusement
          park to be built near Los Angeles. When Disneyland opened in 1955,
          much of Disney's disposition toward nostalgic sentiment and fantasy
          was evident in its design and construction. It soon became a mecca for
          tourists from around the world. A second Disney park, Walt Disney
          World, near Orlando, Florida, which was under construction at the time
          of his death, opened in 1971.
